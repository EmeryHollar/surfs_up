Using SQL and Python to analyze climate results
# Overview
The main purpose of the analysis is to analyze weather trends of Oahu, Hawaii from 2010-2017 and determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. I was able to analyze the data by importing the data from SQLAlchemy to a pandas dataframe, and determine the summary statistics for the months of June and December respectively.

# Results 
-	As shown in the charts here, the mean temperature for June in Oahu is roughly 80 degrees, while the mean temperature for December in Oahu is roughly 71 degrees. 
-	Still referencing the charts above, the minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and the minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees. 
-	Another key difference in the weather in June and December in Oahu is the standard deviation for June weather is roughly 3.2 degrees, while the December std deviation in temperature is 3.7 degrees, meaning the weather has more variation in December than in June.

# Summary 
The surf and ice cream shop that W. Avy wants to open in Oahu, Hawaii could definitely be opened year round. The temperatures in June show that the store should attract a large customer base for the summer months when the weather is at its warmest. The temperatures in December show that the weather should be warm enough to open in the colder months; however the minimum temperatures in December show the weather can dip into the 50s. But overall the weather will be warm enough on average in December to justify opening the store year round. Additional queries I performed were to see if rising temperatures annually have affected the December temperature. Although climate change is a huge problem that needs to be controlled, the rising temperatures for W. Avyâ€™s business show that in 2010 the average December temperature was 70 degrees and in the most recent recordings in 2016 the December temperature average was 71 degrees. With the rising temperatures, the surf and ice cream store should be considered a year round store.
